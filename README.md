# Pukki

A Christmas gift wishlist for small groups of family and friends. Made to help organize who's buying what for who.

## More info

Created with NextJS, wanted to try some SSR stuff. Database is on [Supabase](https://supabase.com/). Could easily be broken (there's no RLS). Went with Facebook as a login to keep it simple.

This app is also a PWA, and can be saved for use as a standalone application.

## What's with the name?

Joulupukki = Santa Claus in Finnish. It translates directly to _"Christmas Goat"_. Pukki just means goat.

## To do

- ~~Remove SSR, it doesn't feel like a very nice experience with this type of app~~
- Allow multiple people to claim a gift for a person (i.e. they split it)
- ~~Translate to Finnish~~
